## Dataset:
- 117 high-resolution images from 30 pomegranate trees.  
- Captured from both sunlit and shaded sides in various angles.  
- Split into Training (70%), Testing (15%), and Validation (15%).

- Images are categorized into two classes: Healthy fruits and Defective/Cracked fruits.

## Main Challenges:  
- Noise from leaves, dust, and lighting variations hinder detection in the field.  
- Complexity of real-world environments with occlusions from foliage, branches, and fruit clusters.  
- Small, hard-to-detect objects.  
- Imbalanced dataset.

## YOLOv10 Algorithm: 
YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a well-known real-time object detection algorithm. The architecture includes three main components:  
- Backbone: Extracts features using convolutional layers and advanced layers like C2f and SCDown for enhanced feature learning.  
- Neck: Combines multi-level information to improve detection quality.  
- Head: The final layer, where object detection occurs, including bounding box and label predictions.  
YOLOv10 is available in multiple model variants (n, s, m, l, xl) to balance speed and accuracy depending on hardware and task requirements.

## Baisline Results:
The default YOLOv10 model was evaluated using a learning rate of 0.001. 
The model showed high precision for both "pomegranate" and "defective" categories, but recall and F1-score were notably low for the "defective" category.

## Alterations and Improvements:
- **Hyperparameter tuning**: Slight improvement in accuracy (0.38).  
- **Model variant transition**: Moved from the Nano to the Small variant, improving all metrics (accuracy: 0.44).  
- **Residual connections**: Enabled in the C2fCIB block, leading to a minor improvement in accuracy (0.451).  
- **Activation functions**: Experimented with ReLU6 and Mish, resulting in similar results (decline in performance).  
- **Kernel size adjustment**: Defined kernel size in the RepVGG block, resulting in a minor accuracy boost (0.455).  
- **Final hyperparameter tuning**: Major improvement in accuracy (0.5353). 

## Performance Comparison:
The optimized model showed a significant improvement in recall, especially for defective pomegranates (+121%), enhancing both defect detection and yield estimation.
